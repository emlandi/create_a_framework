Assignment for JSDA Week 2
Group: Emily, Michael & Ansoo

Create a series of help libraries/functions for creating REST APIs using the node HTTP module.

This is a pretty open ended assignment and you're welcome to take it as far as you want. The final project should be able to be brought into a Javascript file using the require function and should also be able to be published on npm. It should be well testing and be setup on TravisCI...  don't forget the docs!

Submit the repo, no need to submit as a pull request.
